# Virtual Pet Shelter

A virtual pet shelter housing pets in need of food, water, play time, and, of course, adoption.

User can choose to feed or water all the pets in the shelter. 
User can decide to play with individual pets after reading their descriptions and choosing one.
User can "surrender" a new pet to the shelter. After entering the pet's name and description, the new pet is added to the collection. But these pets need a little time to adjust, so they can't be adopted immediately.
User can choose to adopt a pet, which removes a pet from the shelter's collection.

Pet's levels of hunger, thirst, and boredom depreciate slowly with each user interaction, and increase when the user chooses to feed, water, or play with pets.
